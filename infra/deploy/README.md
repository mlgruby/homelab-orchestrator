# Deployment Helpers

Infrastructure is currently managed in a separate repository.

This directory is intentionally kept as a placeholder for future migration,
when infrastructure definitions and deployment scripts are moved into this
repository.

Until then:
- Keep infrastructure changes in the current infra repository.
- Use this repository for Windmill/n8n orchestration assets and workflows.
